# octoberPythonClone
Recreating a screenshot of the Python website


1.  FORK this repo. This will give you your own remote repo.
2.  CLONE your repo into your local machine. This will give you a folder that contains this project. You will know if you've done this correctly if you have are given a new folder called "octoberPythonClone".
3.  Navigate into your new folder and CREATE another folder named with your name. Don't touch any of the existing files you may find in there!
4.  ADD your code for the Python Clone assignment the folder you created in step 3. BE CERTAIN there are no nested git repos! (Since you cloned this project from your own remote repo, octoberPythonClone is already a git repo. Leave that git repo be! You want that git repo. But you do not want any other git repos in any of the folders within octoberPythonClone.)
5.  PUSH your code to your own remote repo. (Of course this will also require *git add* and *git commit*.)
6.  Send me a PULL REQUEST.
